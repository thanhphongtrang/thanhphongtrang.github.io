## 🚗 Overview

When global supply chain issues (2021-2023) extended car delivery times to 8-12 months, the post-purchase "waiting" phase became a critical churn risk. I initiated and led the development of a new digital experience to engage, educate, and support customers from the moment of order to the day of delivery.

During 2021–2023, global logistics disruptions and the semiconductor shortage caused car delivery times to stretch up to **8–12 months**. This left a major engagement gap between **order and delivery**.

While most traditional OEMs only provided **delivery tracking**, **Tesla** stood out by offering an **educational experience** that built anticipation and product understanding before delivery.

In 2023, I led the **Order-to-Delivery Mobile Experience** project to turn this waiting period into a **learning journey**, empowering customers to explore their upcoming car, understand ownership options (PCP, PCH, etc.), and feel emotionally connected while waiting.

### My Dual Role

- As **Product Manager**, I defined the strategy, conducted market research, managed the backlog, and aligned stakeholders on transforming this "problem" into a competitive advantage.
- As **Instructional Designer**, I structured the educational journey, designing bite-sized learning modules about complex car features, EV charging, and financial terms (PCP/PCH).

## 💡 Problem Statement

### Customers faced:

- Long waiting periods (up to 1 year) with limited updates - the wait was a "black box" for customers
- Modern cars are complex. Customers were arriving on delivery day with zero knowledge of their new vehicle's features, EV charging, or their own financial agreements (PCP/PCH/Subscription).
- Reduced excitement and trust due to poor transparency and lack of engagement.

### For the brand:

- Lost engagement opportunities during the most emotionally charged phase.
- Increased pressure on agents due to repetitive inquiries ("When will my car arrive?").
- Missed potential to upsell or reinforce brand loyalty before delivery.

## User Research

We conducted qualitative research to understand the **needs, emotions, and behaviors** of customers during the long order-to-delivery period — a critical but often overlooked engagement phase.

### 🧩 Participant Segments

| Segment | Description | Key Questions Explored |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| **1. First-time EV Buyers** | New to electric vehicles; excited but anxious. | "What do I need to know before my car arrives?" "Will I understand how to charge and maintain it?" |
| **2. Returning Customers** | Existing brand customers switching to EV or new model. | "What's different this time?" "How can I customize or prepare before delivery?" |
| **3. Customer Support Team** | Frontline staff handling inquiries and call logs. | "What do customers most frequently ask or misunderstand?" "How can we reduce repetitive questions?" |

> **💡 Opportunities Identified**
>
> 1. **Transform waiting into learning:** Introduce bite-sized educational modules.
> 2. **Build anticipation:** Story-based milestones and progress updates.
> 3. **Reduce support dependency:** Preemptively answer FAQs through in-app content and onboarding flows.
> 4. **Personalize by persona:** Offer distinct learning paths for first-time vs. returning customers.

## 💭 Ideation Phase

To move from research insights to actionable concepts, I organized two cross-functional ideation workshops, bringing together six key teams:

- Web Checkout
- Salesforce Order Management
- Mobile Apps
- Backend Integration
- Customer Experience
- Digital Learning & Content

The goal was to align on a shared vision of the Order-to-Delivery experience and identify feasible MVP solutions within our technical and organizational constraints.

![Workshop Overview](/assets/portfolio-img/order-delivery/workshop-overview.png)

### Backend-for-frontend Workshop

![Backend Workshop](/assets/portfolio-img/order-delivery/backend-workshop.png)

- **Objective:** Explore how backend systems could support a personalized, learning-driven customer experience without overloading agents.
- **Approach:** Visualized the end-to-end data flow from order creation → tracking → customer communication.
- **Outcome:** Identified dependencies between legacy systems and new mobile modules; clarified integration touchpoints.

> **💡 Insight:** The team realized that enabling dynamic order modifications (e.g., color or package change) would dramatically increase complexity — data handoffs, pricing recalculations, and agent escalations.

### Customer Journey Mapping Workshop

![Customer Journey Workshop](/assets/portfolio-img/order-delivery/journey-workshop.png)

- **Objective:** Map the emotional and functional journey from order to delivery, identifying engagement gaps and opportunities for learning.
- **Activities:** Step-by-step mapping of customer emotions, pain points, and informational needs; alignment with internal workflows.
- **Outcome:**
  - Highlighted critical "silence" periods between order and delivery where engagement drops.
  - Proposed learning and storytelling interventions (e.g., "Your Car Is in Production" microlearning moments).
  - Aligned marketing, tech, and service teams around a unified customer timeline.

**A Big Question:** Should we enable order change? (tradeoff, handover to agents, but want to reduce the agents workload)

> **❓ Key Strategic Challenge: "Should we enable order changes during the waiting period?"**
>
> - **Trade-off:**
>   - *Pros:* Improved customer flexibility and satisfaction.
>   - *Cons:* Major operational complexity, risk of delayed deliveries, and agent overload.
> - **Decision:** Technical systems were **not yet ready**, so we designed **scenarios and recommendations** for phased enablement — starting with informational updates and limited change requests.
