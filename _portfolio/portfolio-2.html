<h2>🚗 Overview</h2>

<p>When global supply chain issues (2021-2023) extended car delivery times to 8-12 months, the post-purchase "waiting" phase became a critical churn risk. I initiated and led the development of a new digital experience to engage, educate, and support customers from the moment of order to the day of delivery.</p>

<p>During 2021–2023, global logistics disruptions and the semiconductor shortage caused car delivery times to stretch up to <strong>8–12 months</strong>. This left a major engagement gap between <strong>order and delivery</strong>.</p>

<p>While most traditional OEMs only provided <strong>delivery tracking</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong> stood out by offering an <strong>educational experience</strong> that built anticipation and product understanding before delivery.</p>

<p>In 2023, I led the <strong>Order-to-Delivery Mobile Experience</strong> project to turn this waiting period into a <strong>learning journey</strong>, empowering customers to explore their upcoming car, understand ownership options (PCP, PCH, etc.), and feel emotionally connected while waiting.</p>

<h3>My Dual Role</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As <strong>Product Manager</strong>, I defined the strategy, conducted market research, managed the backlog, and aligned stakeholders on transforming this "problem" into a competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>As <strong>Instructional Designer</strong>, I structured the educational journey, designing bite-sized learning modules about complex car features, EV charging, and financial terms (PCP/PCH).</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Problem Statement</h2>

<h3>Customers faced:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Long waiting periods (up to 1 year) with limited updates - the wait was a "black box" for customers</li>
  <li>Modern cars are complex. Customers were arriving on delivery day with zero knowledge of their new vehicle's features, EV charging, or their own financial agreements (PCP/PCH/Subscription).</li>
  <li>Reduced excitement and trust due to poor transparency and lack of engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the brand:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lost engagement opportunities during the most emotionally charged phase.</li>
  <li>Increased pressure on agents due to repetitive inquiries ("When will my car arrive?").</li>
  <li>Missed potential to upsell or reinforce brand loyalty before delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💭 Ideation Phase</h2>

<p>To move from research insights to actionable concepts, I organized two cross-functional ideation workshops, bringing together six key teams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web Checkout</li>
  <li>Salesforce Order Management</li>
  <li>Mobile Apps</li>
  <li>Backend Integration</li>
  <li>Customer Experience</li>
  <li>Digital Learning & Content</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal was to align on a shared vision of the Order-to-Delivery experience and identify feasible MVP solutions within our technical and organizational constraints.</p>

<h3>Backend-for-frontend Workshop</h3>

<img src="/assets/portfolio-img/order-delivery/backend-workshop.png" alt="Backend Workshop" style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">

<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore how backend systems could support a personalized, learning-driven customer experience without overloading agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Visualized the end-to-end data flow from order creation → tracking → customer communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identified dependencies between legacy systems and new mobile modules; clarified integration touchpoints.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <p><strong>💡 Insight:</strong> The team realized that enabling dynamic order modifications (e.g., color or package change) would dramatically increase complexity — data handoffs, pricing recalculations, and agent escalations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Customer Journey Mapping Workshop</h3>

<img src="/assets/portfolio-img/order-delivery/journey-workshop.png" alt="Customer Journey Workshop" style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">

<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Map the emotional and functional journey from order to delivery, identifying engagement gaps and opportunities for learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Activities:</strong> Step-by-step mapping of customer emotions, pain points, and informational needs; alignment with internal workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Highlighted critical "silence" periods between order and delivery where engagement drops.</li>
      <li>Proposed learning and storytelling interventions (e.g., "Your Car Is in Production" microlearning moments).</li>
      <li>Aligned marketing, tech, and service teams around a unified customer timeline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Big Question:</strong> Should we enable order change? (tradeoff, handover to agents, but want to reduce the agents workload)</p>

<blockquote style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <p><strong>❓ Key Strategic Challenge: "Should we enable order changes during the waiting period?"</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Pros:</em> Improved customer flexibility and satisfaction.</li>
        <li><em>Cons:</em> Major operational complexity, risk of delayed deliveries, and agent overload.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Technical systems were <strong>not yet ready</strong>, so we designed <strong>scenarios and recommendations</strong> for phased enablement — starting with informational updates and limited change requests.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>🔄 Handover & Transition</h2>

<p>As the project reached the execution planning phase, a <strong>company-wide reorganization</strong> took place. My role transitioned from leading the <em>Order-to-Delivery Experience</em> initiative to becoming the <strong>Product Manager of Web Foundation</strong>, focusing on the <strong>eCommerce Search product</strong> — the underlying search and discovery experience across all digital channels.</p>

<p>Recognizing the strategic importance of continuity, I led a <strong>structured handover process</strong> to ensure the project's successful progression under the new Mobile Product Manager.</p>

<h3>🧩 Handover Activities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Created a comprehensive <strong>handover package</strong>, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Workshop summaries, research findings, and system anatomy documentation.</li>
      <li>MVP roadmap and prioritized backlog in collaboration with UX and Tech leads.</li>
      <li>Learning content strategy and modular curriculum plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conducted <strong>joint review sessions</strong> with the new PM, UX lead, and engineering manager to ensure alignment on product vision and dependencies.</li>
  <li>Continued to support the <strong>mobile product team</strong> as an advisor on:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning content integration and instructional design consistency.</li>
      <li>Data-informed engagement metrics.</li>
      <li>System interoperability with web and CRM foundations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This ensured <strong>knowledge continuity</strong>, minimized delivery risk, and maintained strategic alignment across the product ecosystem.</p>

<h2>🌱 Key Learnings</h2>

<h3>1. Customer Education as a Growth Lever</h3>

<p>Turning waiting time into a learning experience transformed a logistical problem into a brand-building opportunity. This reinforced how <strong>instructional design can elevate customer experience and retention</strong>.</p>

<h3>2. Cross-Domain Collaboration Is Critical</h3>

<p>Bringing together teams from sales, backend, web, mobile, and content required not just coordination, but a shared understanding of <em>why</em> the customer experience mattered beyond individual functions.</p>

<h3>3. System Thinking Enables Scalable Design</h3>

<p>By mapping system dependencies early, we avoided isolated solutions. The <strong>System Anatomy</strong> became a blueprint for future connected experiences across web and mobile.</p>

<h3>4. Designing for Emotion and Information</h3>

<p>Balancing <strong>emotional anticipation</strong> (storytelling, milestones) with <strong>practical education</strong> (how-to, finance learning) created a deeper, more meaningful engagement journey.</p>

<h3>5. Adaptability in Product Leadership</h3>

<p>Navigating organizational change taught me the importance of <strong>clear documentation, collaborative handovers, and continuous stakeholder engagement</strong> — ensuring product momentum even beyond one's direct ownership.</p>
