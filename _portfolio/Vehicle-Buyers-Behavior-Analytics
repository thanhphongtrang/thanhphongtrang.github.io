title: "The Search That Changed Everything: A 48-Hour Analytics Sprint That Drove $2M in Revenue"

excerpt: "When stakeholders demanded insights on a failing search feature with 15% missing data, I had two choices: wait for perfect data or deliver imperfect insights fast. Here's how transparency, pragmatism, and a regional-product averaging hack turned incomplete data into a 12% conversion lift across 112 markets.

<h2>📖 The Story at a Glance</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>The Setting:</strong> Product Analyst at a global automotive e-commerce platform, 112 markets, 10,000+ daily searches</li>

<li><strong>The Crisis:</strong> New semantic search feature launched but conversion was tanking. Stakeholders needed answers yesterday. Data was 15% incomplete.</li>

<li><strong>The Journey:</strong>

<ul>

<li>48-hour sprint to deliver interim insights despite incomplete data</li>

<li>Built trust through radical transparency about data limitations</li>

<li>Scaled from 1 market MVP to 112-market analytics framework</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> <em>12%</em> order completion lift • <em>25%</em> latency drop • <em>7,400</em> queries cleaned for GenAI • <em>60%</em> reduction in ad-hoc requests</li>

<li><strong>The Tools:</strong> SQL, Python, Databricks, Power BI, GA4, Azure OpenAI</li>

</ul>

</div>

<h1>🎬 Act I: The Phone Call That Started Everything</h1>

<p>It was a Tuesday morning when my Slack lit up. The VP of Digital Experience wanted to meet. Now.</p>

<p>"Our new semantic search is live," she said, pulling up a dashboard. "But conversion is lower than our old keyword search. We need to know why. Can you have insights by Friday?"</p>

<p>I opened the data pipeline. My stomach sank.</p>

<h2>The Problem: A Data Nightmare</h2>

<p>What I found wasn't just challenging—it was a mess:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Incomplete data:</strong> <em>15%</em> of sales records across 112 markets had NULL values. You can't analyze revenue impact when you don't know the revenue.</li>

<li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> "Friday" meant 3 days. The executive team was meeting Monday to decide whether to kill the feature.</li>

<li><strong>Global complexity:</strong> 112 markets meant 112 different data quality patterns. Sweden's data? Pristine. Smaller markets? Swiss cheese.</li>

<li><strong>Cross-functional chaos:</strong> Data science wanted perfect ML models. Engineering wanted to ship fixes. UX wanted to run more tests. Governance wanted data lineage documentation. Everyone was pulling in different directions.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding-left: 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; color: #555;">

"I had two choices: Tell them to wait 2 months for clean data, or figure out how to deliver insights they could trust with the messy data I had."

— My internal dialogue, probably while stress-eating Swedish fika

<h1>🎬 Act II: The 48-Hour Sprint</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Hack That Saved the Day</h2>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 15px 0;">

<p><strong>The Toolbox:</strong> SQL, Databricks, Snowflake, and one clever heuristic</p>

</div>

<p>I couldn't fix the data quality overnight. But I could be smart about the <em>15%</em> of missing values.</p>

<p>Here's the insight: If I didn't know the sales value for an XC40 in Portugal, I could use the average sales value for XC40s across all Portuguese sales. Not perfect—but good enough to spot patterns.</p>

<h3>The Code That Made It Happen</h3>

<pre><code class="language-sql">

-- The regional-product averaging hack

-- Simple idea: If we don't know this car's sales in this region,

-- use the average for this car model in this region

WITH regional_product_avg AS (

SELECT 

region,

product_id,

AVG(sales_value) as avg_sales

FROM sales_data

WHERE sales_value IS NOT NULL

GROUP BY region, product_id

),

sales_enriched AS (

SELECT 

s.order_id,

s.region,

s.product_id,

[s.search](http://s.search)_term,

s.sales_value,

r.avg_sales as regional_product_avg,

-- Here's the magic: use real value if we have it, average if we don't

COALESCE(s.sales_value, r.avg_sales) as sales_value_clean

FROM sales_data s

LEFT JOIN regional_product_avg r

ON s.region = r.region 

AND s.product_id = r.product_id

)

SELECT * FROM sales_enriched;

</code></pre>

<h3>The Outcome: Trust Through Transparency</h3>

<p>48 hours later, I walked into that meeting with a deck. But I didn't start with the insights—I started with the truth:</p>

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 20px 0;">

<p style="font-style: italic;">"Before we dive into what the data tells us, here's what you need to know: <em>15%</em> of our sales records are incomplete. I've used regional-product averages to fill the gaps. This approach is solid enough for the decisions we need to make today, but it has limitations..."</p>

</div>

<p>Then I showed them three things:</p>

<ul>

<li>✅ <strong>The interim insights</strong> they could use immediately to guide product decisions</li>

<li>✅ <strong>A clear breakdown</strong> of what was solid vs. what had caveats</li>

<li>✅ <strong>A 2-month plan</strong> to improve data quality by <em>90%</em> (which we later achieved)</li>

</ul>

<p>The VP leaned back. "This is exactly what we needed. Let's move forward."</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

<h2>Chapter 2: What the Users Were Actually Doing</h2>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 15px 0;">

<p><strong>The Detective Tools:</strong> GA4, Python, Databricks, and a lot of SQL queries</p>

</div>

<p>With clean-enough data, I could finally answer the real question: <em>What were users actually searching for, and why wasn't it working?</em></p>

<h3>The Data Sources: Where the Story Was Hiding</h3>

| Source | What It Told Us | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GA4 | Every click, every search query, every moment of hesitation | <em>10,000+</em> events/day |
| Snowflake | The moment of truth: did they buy? | Real-time sync |

<h3>The Framework: Making Sense of Chaos</h3>

<p>I built a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework to organize our thinking. No more random metric requests—everything had a purpose.</p>

<img src="/assets/porfolio-img/behavior-analytics/metrics-framework.png" alt="Metrics Framework" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="flex: 1;">

<h4>📊 What We Could Control</h4>

<ul>

<li>How many people started a search</li>

<li>Which search type they used (default, keyword, auto-suggest)</li>

<li>How many refinements they made</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div style="flex: 1;">

<h4>🎯 What We Needed to Monitor</h4>

<ul>

<li>Engagement rate: Did they click on results?</li>

<li>Click position: Were the right results at the top?</li>

<li>Zero-result searches: Where were the content gaps?</li>

</ul>

</div>

</div>

<h3>The Python Code That Found the Patterns</h3>

<pre><code class="language-python">

import pandas as pd

# This is where the story was hiding: in 300,000 daily search events

search_events = spark.sql("""

SELECT 

user_pseudo_id,

event_date,

search_term,

search_result_count,

event_name,

event_label

FROM ga4_events

WHERE event_category = 'global search'

""").toPandas()

# Calculate engagement: Are people finding what they want?

engagement_metrics = search_events.groupby('event_date').agg({

'user_pseudo_id': 'nunique',

'search_term': 'count',

'search_result_count': 'mean'

}).rename(columns={

'user_pseudo_id': 'unique_users',

'search_term': 'total_searches',

'search_result_count': 'avg_results_returned'

})

# The goldmine: What were people searching for that returned nothing?

zero_results = search_events[

search_events['search_result_count'] == 0

].groupby('search_term').size().sort_values(ascending=False)

# This simple analysis revealed content gaps worth millions

</code></pre>

<h3>The Discoveries That Changed Everything</h3>

<ul>

<li>🎯 <em>65%</em> engagement rate after optimization—people were clicking on results</li>

<li>💡 Top 20 zero-result searches revealed exactly where our content was failing</li>

<li>⚡ <em>30%</em> fewer search refinements meant people were finding what they wanted faster</li>

</ul>

<h2>Chapter 3: Making Data Tell a Story</h2>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 15px 0;">

<p><strong>The Communication Tools:</strong> Power BI, Azure OpenAI, and the art of executive storytelling</p>

</div>

<p>Raw data doesn't change minds. Stories do.</p>

<p>I built a 3-page dashboard that executives could understand in 5 minutes. No jargon. No database schemas. Just the story of what was happening and what to do about it.</p>

<h4>Page 1: The Executive View — "Here's What's Happening"</h4>

<img src="/assets/porfolio-img/behavior-analytics/dashboard-executive.png" alt="Executive Dashboard" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>Big numbers. Clear trends. One question answered: Are we winning or losing?</p>

<h4>Page 2: The Deep Dive — "Here's Why It's Happening"</h4>

<img src="/assets/porfolio-img/behavior-analytics/dashboard-behavior.png" alt="Behavioral Dashboard" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>For the curious PM who wants to understand user behavior patterns and seasonal effects.</p>

<h4>Page 3: The Action Plan — "Here's What to Do About It"</h4>

<img src="/assets/porfolio-img/behavior-analytics/dashboard-queries.png" alt="Queries Dashboard" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>GenAI-powered insights showing exactly which content gaps to fill and which features to build.</p>

<h1>🎓 The Lessons (Or: What I'd Tell My Past Self)</h1>

<h2>Lesson 1: Perfect Data is the Enemy of Good Insights</h2>

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 20px 0;">

<p><strong>The Moment:</strong> Stakeholder needed answers. Data was <em>15%</em> incomplete. Clock was ticking.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>What I Did:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>✅ Delivered interim analysis in 48 hours using smart heuristics</li>

<li>✅ Flagged every limitation and assumption in bold, clear language</li>

<li>✅ Started the long-term fix in parallel—achieved <em>90%</em> data quality improvement in 2 months</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>The Email That Built Trust:</strong></p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 15px; margin: 20px 0; color: #555; font-style: italic;">

"I've delivered the interim sales analysis using regional-product averages to handle the <em>15%</em> missing data. This approach enables immediate decision-making, but here are the limitations: [X, Y, Z]. In parallel, I've kicked off a data quality initiative with the source teams. Expecting <em>50%</em> improvement within 2 months."

— The email that changed how stakeholders trusted my work

</blockquote>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>✅ VP made the go/no-go decision without delay</li>

<li>✅ My reputation for transparency went up, not down</li>

<li>✅ Future stakeholders trusted my "good enough" analyses because I'd proven I knew the difference</li>

</ul>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

<h2>Lesson 2: Self-Service Analytics is a Superpower</h2>

<p>I was drowning in ad-hoc requests. "Can you pull this metric?" "What about this slice?" "How does this compare to last quarter?"</p>

<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Build tools that answer questions before they're asked.</p>

<ul>

<li>📊 Created interactive dashboards where anyone could drill down</li>

<li>📚 Wrote clear documentation for non-technical stakeholders</li>

<li>🎓 Ran training sessions on "How to find your own answers"</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>

<div style="background-color: #d4edda; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 15px 0;">

<p><em>60%</em> reduction in ad-hoc analysis requests from the Search Engineering team</p>

</div>

<p>That's 60% more time to work on things that actually move the needle.</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

<h2>Lesson 3: Start Small, Scale Smart</h2>

<p><strong>The Journey:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>🌱 <strong>MVP:</strong> Validated tracking with 1 market (Sweden—cleanest data, fastest iteration)</li>

<li>🌍 <strong>Scale:</strong> Rolled out to 112 markets with localization guides</li>

<li>🔄 <strong>Refine:</strong> Continuously improved based on what each market taught us</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>The Weekly Cycle That Made It Work:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>📅 Monday: Review metrics from all markets</li>

<li>🔍 Tuesday-Wednesday: Identify opportunities (e.g., zero-result searches)</li>

<li>🤝 Thursday: Coordinate with content/UX teams on fixes</li>

<li>📊 Friday: Measure impact of previous week's changes</li>

</ul>
