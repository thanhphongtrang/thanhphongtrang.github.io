      <p>I worked with Phong at Volvo Cars, and I could observe the key role he played in some complex, cross-team initiatives. His leadership was essential on the  EU Accessibility Act work , where he brought together people from multiple functions and markets to ensure  7,000 pages across 27 sites were compliant  with legal directives. He ensured forward motion by planning carefully, staying close to the teams, and keeping everyone in the loop.</p>
      <p>He also played an important role in shaping our web design system, by  setting clear priorities, defining ways to measure success, and testing ideas to show impact . Phong navigates uncertainty and ambiguity very well and has a doer/learner attitude that makes him very adaptable to changes in context.</p>

      <p>I'm pleased to recommend Phong Trang for Product Owner/Product Manager roles. Phong was employed by Volvo Cars from August 2022 until November 2025 as Software Product Manager within Web Foundation under my direct management. During his tenure, Phong demonstrated an  exceptional combination of technical fluency, strategic clarity, analytical rigor, and stakeholder leadership .</p>
      
      <p>Technical fluency driving business outcomes: Phong partnered closely with engineering teams to design and implement an  LLM-powered semantic search solution , introducing an NDCG-based evaluation framework. This capability now handles  ~100,000 searches per month across 100+ market sites  and has been linked to a  ~10% higher purchase completion rate  among search users.</p>
      
      <p> Data-driven decision making:  Phong integrates large-scale quantitative data with  over 10,000 behavioral and contextual signals . He conducted user research (n=25) across UK, US, and SE markets, building a detailed user mental model of search that helped create more intuitive experiences. He also led a quasi-experiment within the design system, quantifying  productivity and quality improvements  across contributors.</p>
      
      <p> Stakeholder management:  Phong successfully orchestrated collaboration among content, platform, quality, governance, and market teams to achieve  accessibility compliance across 7,000+ pages and 27 markets . His structured approach enabled executives to make timely and confident decisions.</p>
      
      <p> Strategic road-mapping under volatility:  Phong built resilient roadmaps that protected key outcomes while adjusting to changing priorities. His value-versus-effort framework enabled efficient re-prioritization, ensuring highest-impact initiatives remained on track while preserving delivery velocity and team morale.</p>
